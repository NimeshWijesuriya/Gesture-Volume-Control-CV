# Gesture Volume Control Using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project implements a gesture-based volume control system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyCaw. The application captures hand gestures using a webcam and controls the system volume by tracking the distance between the thumb and index finger. 

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Adjusts system volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.
- Smooth interaction using Python's PyCaw library to control audio levels.
- Visual feedback of gestures on the screen with OpenCV.
